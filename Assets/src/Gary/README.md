My feature for the Incoming!! video game is an adaptive audio system.
When a player loses health by being struck with an enemy dodgeball, a music track lowpass filter’s threshold and level of attenuation will be adjusted downwards in relation to the amount of health the player is missing, and a “ringing ears” effect that includes a 10khz tone as well as a throbbing heartbeat will be played with an amplitude related to the amount of health the player is missing.
