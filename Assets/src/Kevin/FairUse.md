There are certain circumstances where the use of a digital asset without attribution could be considered fair use under US copyright law. However, fair use is a complex and often subjective legal concept, and each case will depend on the specific facts and circumstances involved.

In general, fair use is a legal doctrine that allows the limited use of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner. To determine whether a particular use is fair use, courts typically consider four factors:

- The purpose and character of the use
- The nature of the copyrighted work
- The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole
- The effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

While it is possible that a particular use without attribution could be considered fair use under certain circumstances, it is important to note that fair use is not a blanket exception to copyright law. It is a nuanced and fact-specific analysis, and the outcome of any given fair use case will depend on the specific facts and circumstances involved.

In general, it is always best to err on the side of caution and provide proper attribution when using digital assets to avoid any potential legal issues.
