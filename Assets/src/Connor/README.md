My feature for the Incoming!! video game is the enemy AI's and arena bosses.
When the player starts a new stage, enemy AI's should spawn around the fringes of the arena and engage the player as a group. These AI's should be able to maneuver intelligently around and
between cover objects without impeding each other as they pursue the player. Once enough standard AI's are downed, the arena miniboss should then spawn, which will engage the player
with special abilities that the player can unlock for themselves upon beating the miniboss.
