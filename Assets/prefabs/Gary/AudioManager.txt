Unity AudioManager Prefab

Overview:

The AudioManager prefab is a tool to help manage and organize the playback of audioclips
in Unity.  It is a singleton, which makes it persist throughout scene changes.  

The AudioManager arranges clips in public array of the class Sound.cs.  This allows for parameters
such as volume, loop, th audio mixer group, and the name to all be accessed and adjusted in a single pane
of the inspector window when the AudioManager prefab is selected.



Operation:

To add a clip to the AudioManager:
-select the AudioManager in the project. 
-add 1 to the "sounds" array
-drag the audio file into the specified audioclip
-adjust parameters as needed
-call the AudioManager.Play("clipname") on that clip.

When the AudioMixer is instantiated, inside the Awake() function there is a loop that will
add an audiosource for each sound in the Sound[] array.  Each Sound[] element will also have the
paramaters loop, volume, clip, and audioMixerGroup added to the its specific audiosource as well.
